## Docker run## Docker run

To run a Docker container, use the following command:
Replace `<options>` with the desired flags (e.g., `-d` for detached mode, `-p` for port mapping) and `<image>` with the name of the Docker image you want to run.

Example:
This command runs an Nginx container in detached mode and maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container.
